    "The purpose of this project is to analyze the how the electoral college votes were distributed after the 2010 census, look at how the redistribution of population (by estimate) has shifted over time until today, and what that means for the voter per electoral college vote in each state. I will also analyze how we expect the electoral college to be redistributed after the 2020 census, given census bureau predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis will also be performed on the percentage likelihood of each state giving its electoral college votes to a particular party and their respective nominees, based purely on historical data. The aim is to demonstrate which states have the greatest power per vote, given both their current electoral votes allotted and the likelihood of that state assigning thier votes to either candidate."
